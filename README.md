# Ticketing System Improvements

## Identified toil

Recurring obsolete issues

Lack of clear prioritization

## Proposed Solutions

Thinking about reducing toil originated in the ticket system, we can use tools capable of improving the alerts grouping and tickets routing and actions customization.

A tool that I have evaluated for this purpose is Grafana OnCall, which has an OpenSource (OSS), Enterprise and Cloud (SaaS) version.

It is an excellent tool that integrates with the Grafana stack, providing faster and more accurate identification and issues solving.
